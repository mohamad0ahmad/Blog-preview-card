## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS flex
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While building this project, I reinforced my understanding of **Flexbox** for centering elements both vertically and horizontally, and I also practiced **responsive design** using a mobile-first workflow.  
I also learned how to:

- Use `fit-content` for element sizing so borders wrap exactly around content.
- Apply hover and focus states to links to make the UI more interactive.
- Properly use the universal selector `*` for resets without affecting performance.
- Keep components reusable and neatly styled with clean class targeting.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve my mastery of CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Practice creating reusable CSS components and utility classes.
- Work more with accessibility best practices, ensuring all interactive elements are usable via keyboard navigation and screen readers.

### Useful resources

- [HTML Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/) - This helped me for remembering HTML tags and attributes.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Great for in-depth explanations of CSS properties and HTML elements.
